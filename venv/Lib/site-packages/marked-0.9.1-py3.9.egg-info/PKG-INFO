        Introduction
        ------------
        
        ``marked`` is a library and CLI utility for transforming HTML-ish (HTML, XHTML, HTML5 etc.)
        documents and fragments into `makrdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_
        formatted content.
        
        
        It is inspired by Aaron Swartz' `html2text <http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/html2text/>`_, but
        with a more permissive license_, and using the excellent `BeautifulSoup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_
        library for extremely flexible markup parsing.
